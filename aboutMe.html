    <h1>Some info about me</h1>
    <p class="small">
        I'm a senior Computer Science major, with a concentration in
        networking. I grew up right here in Delaware, in Hockessin. I
        really enjoy programming and I'm excited for what I can learn
        in this class to add to what I already know.
        Below is my dog, Sadie :)
